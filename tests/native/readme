This is a very simple guide to get the native code up and running fro minimum set of tasks, a bunch of nodes and a lookup
server, its WIP and is been added to as we use it to debug more and more of the platform.

use build.sh tests debug to build the native code, it will create a directory called build and put the binaries in there.

from the zilliqa/build directory

./tests/native/start_native.sh

That's it, more coming soon, this will fire up a system with ten nodes and a lookup server using the constants.xml in the root of Zilliqa.

The software makes a copy and overrides all the values it specifically needs.

The software currently creates subdirectories under the build directory, these are local_run - contains the normal nodes , lookup_local_run contains the lookup server.

Each directory has one directory per node, the node directory contains the node specific files, the lookup directory contains the lookup specific files.

This is where you will find the relevant logs and other useful files for debugging.

More coming soon.

Steve.
