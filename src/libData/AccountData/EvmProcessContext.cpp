/* EvmProcessContext
 * *
 * This structure is the holding structure for data about
 * to be passed to the evm-ds processing engine.
 *
 * Balances within Zilliqa Blockchain are  :
 * measured in the smallest accounting unit Qa (or 10^-12 Zil).
 *
 * This Context is targeted at an ETH Evm based engine, therefore
 * storage for this context is in gwei (Ethereum units).
 * Gwei is a denomination of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH),
 * used on the Ethereum network to buy and sell goods and services.
 * Â· A gwei is one-billionth of one ETH.
 *
 * Incoming Zil/Qa will be converted to Eth/Gwei using the following methodology
 *
 * At the time of writing, MIN_ETH_GAS = 21000, NORMAL_TRAN_GAS = 50;
 * SCALING_FACTOR = MIN_ETH_GAS / NORMAL_TRAN_GAS;
 * Therefore this module uses a scaling factor of 21000/50 or 420
 *
 * This should not be confused with the EVM_ZIL_SCALING_FACTOR which is set at
 * 1000000 in the configuration.
