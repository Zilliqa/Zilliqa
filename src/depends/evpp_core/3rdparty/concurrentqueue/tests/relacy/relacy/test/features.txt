 - Exhaustive automatic error checking (including ABA detection).
 - Full-fledged atomics library (with spurious failures in compare_exchange()).
 - Memory fences.
 - Arbitrary number of threads.
 - Detailed execution history for failed tests.
 - No false positives.
 - Before/after/invariant functions for test suites.
