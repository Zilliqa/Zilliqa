/** A thread can construct a task_scheduler_init object and keep it alive
    while it uses TBB's tasking subsystem (including parallel algorithms).

    This class allows to customize properties of the TBB task pool to some extent.
    For example it can limit concurrency level of parallel work initiated by the
    given thread. It also can be used to specify stack size of the TBB worker threads,
    though this setting is not effective if the thread pool has already been created.

    If a parallel construct is used without task_scheduler_init object previously
    created, the scheduler will be initialized automatically with default settings,
    and will persist until this thread exits. Default concurrency level is defined
    as described in task_scheduler_init::initialize().

        Because tbb 2.0 does not support blocking tasks yet, you may use this method
        to boost the number of threads in the tbb's internal pool, if your tasks are 
        doing I/O operations. The optimal number of additional threads depends on how
        much time your tasks spend in the blocked state.
        
        Before TBB 3.0 U4 this method returned the number of logical CPU in the
        system. Currently on Windows, Linux and FreeBSD it returns the number of
        logical CPUs available to the current process in accordance with its affinity
        mask.
        
        NOTE: The return value of this method never changes after its first invocation. 
        This means that changes in the process affinity mask that took place after
        this method was first invoked will not affect the number of worker threads
        in the TBB worker threads pool. */
