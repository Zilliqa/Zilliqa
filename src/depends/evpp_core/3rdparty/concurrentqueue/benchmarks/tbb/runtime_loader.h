namespace tbb {

namespace interface6 {

//! Load TBB at runtime.
/*!

\b Usage:

In source code:

\code
#include "tbb/runtime_loader.h"

char const * path[] = { "<install dir>/lib/ia32", NULL };
tbb::runtime_loader loader( path );

// Now use TBB.
\endcode

Link with \c tbbproxy.lib (or \c libtbbproxy.a) instead of \c tbb.lib (\c libtbb.dylib,
\c libtbb.so).

TBB library will be loaded at runtime from \c <install dir>/lib/ia32 directory.

\b Attention:

All \c runtime_loader objects (in the same module, i.e. exe or dll) share some global state.
The most noticeable piece of global state is loaded TBB library.
There are some implications:

    -   Only one TBB library can be loaded per module.

    -   If one object has already loaded TBB library, another object will not load TBB.
        If the loaded TBB library is suitable for the second object, both will use TBB
        cooperatively, otherwise the second object will report an error.

    -   \c runtime_loader objects will not work (correctly) in parallel due to absence of
        synchronization.

            The method searches the directories specified in \c path[] array for the TBB library.
            When the library is found, it is loaded and its version is checked. If the version is
            not suitable, the library is unloaded, and the search continues.

            \b Note:

            For security reasons, avoid using relative directory names. For example, never load
            TBB from current (\c "."), parent (\c "..") or any other relative directory (like
            \c "lib" ). Use only absolute directory names (e. g. "/usr/local/lib").

            For the same security reasons, avoid using system default directories (\c "") on
            Windows. (See http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2269637.mspx for
            details.)

            Neglecting these rules may cause your program to execute 3-rd party malicious code.

            \b Errors:
                -   \c ec_bad_call - TBB already loaded by this object.
                -   \c ec_bad_arg - \p min_ver and/or \p max_ver negative or zero,
                    or \p min_ver > \p max_ver.
                -   \c ec_bad_ver - TBB of unsuitable version already loaded by another object.
                -   \c ec_no_lib - No suitable library found.
