# Importing and updating dashboards

In this folder you should find several JSON files that can be used to pre-populate dashboards in grafana once you have it setup.

To import:

Dashboards -> Import+
then paste JSON in or upload the file

NOTE: They may initially indicate no data as Txns have not been flowing through the system and generating the metrics. Look at networking metrics
to see the first metrics that should be generated when a network starts up.

If you add metrics please update the JSON to persist and share your changes. On the dashboard click the share icon
->
