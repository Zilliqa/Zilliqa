## Overview
Zilliqa is a new blockchain platform capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with sharding built into it. With sharding, Zilliqa has the potential to match throughput benchmarks set by traditional payment methods (such as _VISA_ and _MasterCard_). More importantly, Zilliqaâ€™s transaction throughput increases (roughly) linearly with its network size.

# Running Zilliqa locally (using 10 shard nodes and DS node locally)  
1. Build Zilliqa from the source.  
` ./build.sh`

2. Run the local testnet script in `build` directory
`cd build && ./tests/Node/test_node_simple.sh`  

3. Logs of each node can be found at `./local_run`

4. To terminate Zilliqa,   
`pkill zilliqa`
