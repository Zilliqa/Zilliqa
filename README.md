# Zilliqa (codename _Durian_)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zilliqa/Zilliqa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zilliqa/Zilliqa) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Zilliqa/Zilliqa/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Zilliqa/Zilliqa)

## Overview
Zilliqa is a new blockchain platform capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with sharding built into it. With sharding, Zilliqa has the potential to match throughput benchmarks set by traditional payment methods (such as _VISA_ and _MasterCard_). More importantly, Zilliqaâ€™s transaction throughput increases (roughly) linearly with its network size.

## Red Prawn Testnet  
* [Block Explorer](https://explorer.zilliqa.com/home)
* [Wallet](https://wallet.zilliqa.com/)  

## Available Features
The current release has the following features implemented:
* Proof of Work 1 (PoW1) and 2 (PoW2) for joining the network
* Network sharding
* Directory Service
* Consensus for DS block, Sharding structure, Shard Microblock and Final block 
* [EC-Schnorr signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature)
* Data layer and accounts store 
* Looking up nodes to allow new nodes to join 
* Persistent storage for transactions
* [Merkle Patricia tree](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree)
* Transaction verification
* Zilliqa Wallet

In the coming months, we plan to have the following features:
* View change
* Gossip protocol for network message broadcasting
* Incentive structure
* Smart contract design and implementation
* GPU support for PoW
* Further unit and integration tests
* Enhancement of existing features
* More operating system support
* And much more ...

## Minimum system requirements
To run Zilliqa, we recommend the following minimum system requirements:
* x64 _Linux_ operating system such as _Ubuntu_
* Recent dual core processor
* 2 GB RAM

> Note: Presently we are in active development on Ubuntu 16.04. The support for
> building on other Ubuntu versions or other OSes is pending.

## Dependencies
To compile and run the Zilliqa codebase, you will need the following dependencies to be installed on your machine:\
* `build-essential`
* `Boost` 
* `CMake`
* `clang-format`
* `git`
* `JsonCpp`
* `json-rpc-cpp`
* `LevelDB`
* `OpenSSL`
* `pkg-config`
* `libevent`
* `miniupnpc`
* Dependencies only required for builds with code coverage enabled
    * `gcov`
    * `lcov`
* Dependencies only required for builds on Travis-CI
    * `curl`

For Ubuntu 16.04, you can use the following command (or refer to `./scripts/ci_install_deps.sh`) to install the dependencies:  

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install git clang-format-5.0 clang-tidy-5.0 clang-5.0 libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev libssl-dev libleveldb-dev libjsoncpp-dev libsnappy-dev cmake libmicrohttpd-dev libjsonrpccpp-dev build-essential pkg-config libevent-dev libminiupnpc-dev
```

For Mac OS X (experimental), you can use the following command to install the dependencies:  
```bash
brew install pkg-config jsoncpp leveldb libjson-rpc-cpp libevent miniupnpc
```

# Running Zilliqa locally (using 10 shard nodes and DS node locally)  
1. Build Zilliqa from the source.  
` ./build.sh`

2. Run the local testnet script in `build` directory
`cd build && ./tests/Node/test_node_simple.sh`  

3. Logs of each node can be found at `./local_run`

4. To terminate Zilliqa,   
`pkill zilliqa` 

## Running a Zilliqa Node on the public testnet 
Coming soon...
