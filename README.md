## Overview

Zilliqa is a new blockchain platform capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with sharding built into it. With sharding, Zilliqa has the potential to match throughput benchmarks set by traditional payment methods (such as _VISA_ and _MasterCard_). More importantly, Zilliqaâ€™s transaction throughput increases (roughly) linearly with its network size.

## Minimum system requirements

To run Zilliqa, we recommend the following minimum system requirements:

* x64 _Linux_ operating system such as _Ubuntu_
* Intel i5 processor or later
* 2 GB RAM or higher

> Note: Presently, we are in active development on Ubuntu 16.04. We also support macOS.
> Support for building on other Debian-based distributions are pending.

## Dependencies

* Ubuntu 16.04:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev \
        libssl-dev libleveldb-dev libjsoncpp-dev libsnappy-dev cmake libmicrohttpd-dev \
        libjsonrpccpp-dev build-essential pkg-config libevent-dev libminiupnpc-dev \
        libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libcurl4-openssl-dev
    ```

* macOS:

    ```bash
    brew install boost pkg-config jsoncpp leveldb libjson-rpc-cpp libevent miniupnpc protobuf
    ```

## Running Zilliqa locally

1. Build Zilliqa from the source.  

    ```
    ./build.sh
    ```

2. Run the local testnet script in `build` directory

    ```
   cd build && ./tests/Node/pre_run.sh && ./tests/Node/test_node_lookup.sh && ./tests/Node/test_node_simple.sh
    ```

3. Logs of each node can be found at `./local_run`

4. To terminate Zilliqa,   
    ```
    pkill zilliqa
    ```
